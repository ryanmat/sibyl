# Sibyl

An outcome-fed router for heterogeneous AI models: a confidence cascade, a
Thompson Sampling bandit, and a multi-model panel behind two OpenAI-compatible
surfaces.

## Overview

Sibyl sits behind an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and decides, per request,
which model answers. A cheap classifier scores request complexity. A confidence
cascade starts at the cheapest capable model and escalates only when confidence
is low; with `ROUTING_MODE=bandit`, Thompson Sampling over per-model,
per-domain posteriors makes the pick instead. Decomposable queries can convene
a panel of lineage-diverse models in parallel, with a chair model synthesizing
the answers. Every routing decision is logged as a JSONL row. Grade those rows
against outcomes you care about, write the results back to a SQLite trust DB,
and the trust weights and posteriors reshape future routing. With no trust DB,
it routes on the static cascade.

LiteLLM and OpenRouter are gateways: many models behind one API. Sibyl is a
smaller, more opinionated thing built on the same idea: a learned router with a
measured feedback loop. If you want a gateway, use those. If you want a router
that logs its decisions and improves from graded outcomes, this is a reference
implementation of that, extracted from a production system.

This repository is the public face of Sibyl's routing core and mirrors the
package as it is built internally. The Python package and its entry point keep
their original names, `pdp_router` and `pdp-router-proxy`, from the PDP
(Parallel Distributed Processing) architecture the router grew out of; they
rename at a later major version, and the repository name moved first.

The roster is thirteen models across six training lineages: Anthropic (Opus,
Sonnet, Haiku), Google (Gemini Pro, Flash, Flash-Lite), Meta Llama 4 (Scout
and Maverick via Vertex AI), DeepSeek, and OpenAI and Qwen via OpenRouter. The
lineage spread is deliberate: different training lineages fail differently,
and the panel selects across lineages rather than stacking near-clones.

## Results

At a 100% bandit-routing flip on one production domain, the bandit's outcome
rate was 0.800 vs the static confidence cascade's 0.893 (n=80 graded
decisions, Fisher exact p=0.017), monotonically worsening in 20-row windows.
The flip was reverted to a 10% canary the same day, under a tripwire
pre-committed before the flip.

The reward signal (did the alert clear?) was blind to output quality. A model
emitting garbage text was not penalized as long as the alert resolved. The fix
upstream is a rubric-based judge ensemble as a second outcome source, soaking
before it earns bandit weight.

A learned router beats a good heuristic only when its reward measures what the
user actually cares about.

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `_router.py` | Model registry, capability tiers, confidence cascade, trust-adjusted routing |
| `_bandit.py` | Thompson Sampling over (model, domain, context) with time-discounted observations |
| `_panel.py` | Parallel multi-model panel and chair synthesis, lineage diversity selection |
| `_clients.py` | Provider clients (Anthropic, Gemini and Vertex AI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) behind one `LLMClient` protocol |
| `_proxy.py` | FastAPI OpenAI-compatible endpoints: classify, route, execute, log. Two surfaces (default and OpenAI-faithful) |
| `_effort.py` | Maps the classifier complexity score to a per-provider reasoning-effort level |
| `_cost.py` | Per-provider pricing and cost estimation |
| `_models.py` | Model ID constants and the live roster |
| `_tracing.py` | Optional OpenTelemetry export (traces, metrics, logs, GenAI instrumentation) |

## Setup

Python 3.11 to 3.13.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanmat/sibyl && cd sibyl
cp .env.example .env          # add one provider key
uv sync --all-extras
```

Tests and lint are hermetic: no network, no databases, no credentials.

```bash
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
```

## Usage

```bash
uv run pdp-router-proxy
```

Then point any OpenAI-compatible client at it:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7741/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "pdp-auto", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]}'
```

`model: pdp-auto` engages routing; a concrete model ID pins that model.
`GET /v1/models` lists the roster. `GET /health` reports which provider
credentials actually landed and whether a trust DB was found, so you can
confirm your setup without spending a request.

Two surfaces: `/v1/chat/completions` reports the routed model inline in the
`model` field; `/openai/v1/chat/completions` is byte-faithful for strict agent
clients that reject responses naming a model they did not request.

One provider key is enough. With only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, the Gemini
complexity classifier falls back cross-lineage to Haiku and routing works
normally; the arms you have no credentials for are never selected. With no
trust DB present, the confidence cascade routes on defaults. The learned layer
activates when you bring outcomes (below).

`uv run pdp-router-proxy` is the launch path that reads `.env`. If you invoke
uvicorn directly, either export the variables yourself or use
`uv run --env-file .env uvicorn pdp_router._proxy:app`. Real environment
variables always take precedence over the file.

> No authentication. The proxy binds `127.0.0.1` and has no auth, no rate
> limiting, and no quota. Anything that can reach the port can spend your
> provider credits. Put your own auth in front of it before exposing it
> anywhere, and treat `PROXY_HOST=0.0.0.0` as a deliberate decision.

## Configuration

Defaults are conservative: a fresh clone runs the single-model cascade. The
panel, streaming, effort routing, web search, and tool passthrough are opt-in
environment toggles, documented in `.env.example`. For example,
`PROXY_AUTOPANEL_ENABLED=1` convenes the panel on hard queries.

### Outcomes

The bandit and trust weights read from a SQLite DB (default
`~/.pdp-router/pdp_tracker.db`, override `PROXY_TRUST_DB`) that your grading
process populates:

```sql
CREATE TABLE model_trust (model_id TEXT, weight REAL);          -- 0.0-1.0
CREATE TABLE bandit_state (
  model_id TEXT, mu REAL, sigma REAL, n_obs INTEGER,
  sum_reward REAL, sum_sq_reward REAL,
  effective_n REAL, effective_sum REAL                          -- discounted
);
```

Every request appends a routing-decision row to a JSONL inbox (default
`~/.pdp-router/inbox/proxy-YYYYMMDD.jsonl`, override `PROXY_ROUTING_INBOX_DIR`).
Drain those rows into your store, grade them against whatever outcome you care
about, recompute posteriors, write them back. The router is only as good as
this loop.

Reading a row, the fields that matter most:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `context_json.chat_request_id` | Join on this. The request UUID, identical to the `X-PDP-Prediction-Id` response header. `alert_id` carries it too, as `chat-<uuid>`. |
| `model_selected` | The model that served the request. Group outcomes by this to grade per model. |
| `routing_mode` | The policy that actually produced the pick: `bandit` when Thompson Sampling ran, `cascade` for the thresholds, `explicit` when the caller pinned a model, `panel`/`panel_chair` for panel rows. Group by this to compare policies. |
| `cascade_explored` | `true` when the pick came from the epsilon-greedy explore branch and is uniform-random rather than threshold-driven. Exclude these before computing agreement rates. |

`prediction_id` is a literal `0`, not an identifier. It is a sentinel for "no
upstream prediction id" and joining on it will match every row.

Configuring `ROUTING_MODE=bandit` is not the same as the bandit running: with no
readable `bandit_state` table, routing silently falls through to the cascade. The
proxy warns at startup when that happens, and `routing_mode` on each row records
which policy actually served the request.

### Tracing

Nothing is exported and no GenAI instrumentation is loaded until you set an OTLP
endpoint. Any OTLP-compatible backend works. LangSmith needs no SDK and no extra
dependency, just two variables:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com/otel
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-api-key=<your-key>,Langsmith-Project=sibyl
```

Traces carry the routing decision, token usage, latency, and cost per arm.
Prompt and completion text is not recorded unless you set
`OTEL_CAPTURE_CONTENT=1`, because turning that on ships the content of every
request and response to your backend.
